/*
Algorithm:
Just think you can only make single transaction. so whenver the price goes higher than past you might want to do transaction
because god knows what will happen in future but if this price is less than what you have seen so far you will never make any deal
So keep track of min price so far and profit made so far and finally after seeing all numbers you can tell what you wanted to do and
how much profit you made
